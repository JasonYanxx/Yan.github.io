Satellite-based augmentation systems (SBAS), ground-based augmentation systems (GBAS), and receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) have gained increasing significance in modern aviation to guarantee the safety and reliability of navigation systems [1]–[3]. These systems aim to deliver integrity-assured position solutions to global navigation satellite system (GNSS) users, which typically requires a low integrity risk [4]. Therefore, it is necessary to characterize the error distribution and derive the protection level of positioning solutions [5]. However, using experimental error data to precisely model the error distribution, particularly the tail distribution, presents a formidable challenge [6], [7]. This difficulty arises from the relatively infrequent occurrence of tail observations, requiring enormous data to accurately characterize the tail distribution [6]. Furthermore, incorporating heavy tails and other irregularities in the range error distribution is not a trivial task, since these factors can vary based on satellite azimuth, satellite elevation, receiver hardware, terrain, and season [8]. To address this problem, the overbound, which serves as a conservative representation of the error distribution, is proposed and has become an essential component in integrity research [8], [9]. <br />

DeCleene introduced the CDF overbound in 2000 [9], which is defined as having more tail mass than the error distribution. The zero-mean Gaussian model is adopted as the underly form of the CDF overbound to facilitate the position-to-range projection and simplify the communication and computation of error bounds. Since then, Gaussian-based overbounding methods, such as the paired CDF overbound [10], the excess-mass CDF (EMC) overbound [5], the two-step Gaussian overbound [11], the Gaussian Core overbound, and the Gaussian Core Gaussian Sidelobes overbound [8], have dominated overbounding research and served as the foundation for integrity analysis. However, these methods fail to truly overbound the heavy-tailed distributions, a frequent occurrence in pseudorange errors influenced by multipath [6]. This limitation arises because heavy-tailed distributions possess tails that are not exponentially bounded [4], [8]. Therefore, researchers have been diligently working on developing non-Gaussian overbounding methods to precisely characterize heavy-tailed distributions. For example, Larson et al. proposed the Gaussian-Pareto (GP) overbound, which utilizes the Extreme Value Theory to tightly bound the tails [4]. However, the overbounding property of the GP overbound cannot be preserved through convolution, which limits its applications. Xue et al. utilize the stable distribution to model the GBAS ranging error [12], and Blanch et al. construct a bimodal Gaussian mixture model to accurately model the worst-case pseudorange error [13]. However, these approaches lack a rigorous method to determine the least conservative overbound of the error distribution. <br />

In this study, we present a novel approach to overbounding heavy-tailed error distributions by leveraging the Gaussian mixture model. Specifically, we employ the bimodal Gaussian mixture model (BGMM) and utilize the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm [14] to accurately fit the error distribution. The membership weights of the BGMM are analyzed, and the membership weight of the tail component is proved to be a convex function of the error. Then, we introduce a partitioning strategy based on the convex property of the tail component’s membership weight, which effectively divides the BGMM into the core and tail regions. In each region, one of the Gaussian components of the BGMM holds a dominant position, and a CDF overbound is constructed based on the inflation and shifting of the dominant Gaussian component. The proposed overbound is proved to be an unimodal and symmetric distribution, which indicates that its overbound property can be preserved through convolution.
The bounding performance of the proposed overbounding method is evaluated on the Differential Global Navigation Satellite System (DGNSS) pseudorange data, which is collected from a slightly urbanized area in Hong Kong. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method produces a shaper bound on heavy-tailed error distributions compared to the Gaussian overbound realized by the two-step method [11]. Furthermore, it exhibits competitive bounding performance when compared to the Gaussian-Pareto overbound [4]. In the position domain bounding, the mean vertical protection level (VPL) is reduced by over 50% in comparison to the two-step Gaussian overbounding method [11]. The contributions of this study are two folds: 1) proposed a comprehensive method to determine the CDF overbound for the heavy-tailed error distribution based on the Gaussian mixture model (GMM), where a thorough analysis of the membership weight of the GMM is conducted, and severed as the theoretical foundation for constructing the overbound; 2) proved that the overbound property of the proposed method can be preserved through convolution, making it possible to calculate the protection levels in the position domain and facilitating the applications in integrity monitoring research.<br />
