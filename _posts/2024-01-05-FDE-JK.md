we propose a new test statistic and fault detection method for linearized pseudorange based positioning system under non-Gaussian noises. We prove that the test statistic is a linear combination of measurement noises even without making any assumptions about the measurement noises distribution. Thereby, we develop a hypothesis test based on it and examine its performance on worldwide simulation. A comparison between the proposed method and the solution separation method is shown below.
